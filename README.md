# Chat with Multiple PDFs ðŸ§   

Interact with multiple PDFs in a seamless and intelligent way using this Streamlit app. Powered by **Meta-Llama 3-8B-Instruct** and **ChromaDB**, the application extracts text from uploaded PDFs, creates vector embeddings for efficient context-based search, and answers user questions with AI-generated responses.

---

## Features  
- **PDF Text Extraction**: Upload multiple PDFs, and the app extracts and processes their content.  
- **Context-Aware Q&A**: Ask questions about the content of your documents and receive precise answers.  
- **Vector Search**: Uses ChromaDB for fast and accurate similarity-based search.  
- **Streamlined Interface**: Intuitive Streamlit-powered chat and sidebar for document upload and management.  

---

## How It Works  
1. **Upload PDFs**: Add one or more PDF files using the sidebar.  
2. **Process Files**: Extract text and create vector embeddings from the content.  
3. **Ask Questions**: Input your queries, and the app retrieves relevant context from the documents to generate answers.

## Requirements  

### Environment Variables  
Create a `.env` file with the following:  
```plaintext
HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN=your_huggingface_api_token_here
```

### Dependencies  
Install the required Python packages:  
```bash
pip install streamlit langchain-huggingface huggingface-hub chromadb pypdf python-dotenv
```

## Installation and Setup  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ashishsharma-12/Multi-PDF-Rag-Application.git
   cd Multi-PDF-Rag-Application
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:  
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
   env\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Add your Hugging Face API token to the `.env` file.

5. Run the app:  
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

---

## Usage  

1. Open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.  
2. Upload one or more PDF files via the sidebar.  
3. Process the files to extract text and create a vector database.  
4. Use the chat interface to ask questions about the uploaded documents.  
5. View detailed answers generated by the AI model, with relevant context from the documents.

## Key Components  

- **PDF Text Extraction**: Uses `pypdf` to extract text from uploaded PDFs.  
- **Vector Embeddings**: Leverages `HuggingFaceEmbeddings` and ChromaDB for semantic search.  
- **Language Model**: Utilizes Meta-Llama 3-8B-Instruct for generating detailed responses.  
- **Streamlit Interface**: Interactive UI for file uploads, processing, and Q&A.

## Known Issues  

- PDFs with no extractable text will result in an error. Ensure your documents are text-based (not scanned images).  
- Initial processing may take time depending on the document size and number of uploaded files.  

---

## Future Enhancements  

- Add support for scanned PDFs using OCR (Optical Character Recognition).  
- Optimize vector search for larger datasets.  
- Enable multi-language support for PDFs.
